Finger Paint

nikt

This is my first attempt at an Android app. I am working on this to learn both
java and android. Finger Paint is a simple app that lets you draw on the
screen with a finger.

Currently Finger Paint is very basic. You can:
-draw!
-switch paint colour
-clear screen
-switch background colour

Planned work:
option to load a picture as background
brush size/shape
custom colour selection (RGB)
save screenshot (might not be currently possible - requires root?)
smoother drawing
multitouch (either zoom, drawing with more than one finger, etc)
