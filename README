Finger Paint

nikt

This is my first attempt at an Android app. I am working on this to learn both
java and android. Finger Paint is a simple app that lets you draw on the
screen with a finger.

Currently Finger Paint is very basic. You can draw, switch colours to draw
with, and clear the screen.

Planned work:
option to change background colours
option to load a picture as background
save screenshot
smoother drawing
multitouch (either zoom, drawing with more than one finger, etc)
